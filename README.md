# Web Development 101 - Episode 2: HTML Basics
This repository contains a simple HTML file demonstrating fundamental HTML concepts for web page creation, with a focus on how these elements form the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Overview: HTML Elements and the DOM
The HTML document you see is parsed by the browser into a tree-like structure known as the DOM. Each HTML tag becomes a node in this tree, allowing browsers and scripts to interact with the page's content, structure, and style.

The document illustrates the creation of various DOM nodes through these HTML elements:

1. Content Elements: Tags like `<h1>` (headings), `<p>` (paragraphs), `<li>` (list items), `<table>` (tables), `<a>` (links), and <img> (images) all form element nodes in the DOM. These nodes hold the content that's rendered visually on the webpage.

2. Semantic HTML: Tags like `<section>` create semantic element nodes in the DOM. While visually similar to a `<div>`, a `<section>` node conveys specific meaning about its content's purpose. This semantic structure is crucial for SEO and accessibility, helping machines and assistive technologies understand the document's organization.

3. Forms: Elements such as `<input>` (with types like text, number, radio, checkbox), `<textarea>`, and `<button>` are also element nodes. They are special as they enable user interaction, and their values and events can be accessed and manipulated via the DOM.

## How to View
1. Save: Copy the HTML code and save it as an .html file (e.g., index.html).
2. Open: Double-click the saved file or drag it into any web browser.
